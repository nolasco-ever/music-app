# music-app
This is a music application built from scratch using the Vue JS framework that has a playlist of 7 lofi Christmas songs that the user can listen to and skip through freely. This is a 100% front-end project with no back-end to account for. The program consists of the basic utilities found in all music applications such as a playlist view, a play/pause button, a next button, and a previous button. This project was created in order to learn a new skill of adding media, other than images, to a project. This is the first time that I have added Audio to a project that can be manipulated (played, paused, skipped, etc.).
